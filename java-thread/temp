      Transitions to TERMINATED state if either (SHUTDOWN and pool      and queue empty) or (STOP and pool empty).  If otherwise      eligible to terminate but workerCount is nonzero, interrupts an      idle worker to ensure that shutdown signals propagate. This  method must be called following any action that might make   termination possible -- reducing worker count or removing tasks from the queue during shutdown. The method is non-private to allow access from ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.
